            At ShareBite, we believe that no one should go hungry while food
            goes to waste. Our platform connects those with surplus food to
            people in need, creating a community where generosity and
            sustainability go hand in hand. By reducing food waste and
            redistributing excess, we are making a real difference in the lives
            of individuals and families across our communities.
          </p>
          <p className="py-6">
            Every meal shared through ShareBite is a step towards a world where
            food is valued, not wasted, and where every person has access to
            nutritious meals. Whether you are a donor or a recipient, you are
            part of something biggerâ€”a movement to feed the hungry, protect the
            environment, and build a more compassionate society.
