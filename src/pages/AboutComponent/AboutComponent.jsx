        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          At ShareBite, we believe that no one should go hungry while food goes
          to waste. Our platform connects those with surplus food to people in
          need, creating a community where generosity and sustainability go hand
          in hand. By reducing food waste and redistributing excess, we are
          making a real difference in the lives of individuals and families
          across our communities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Every meal shared through ShareBite is a step towards a world where
          food is valued, not wasted, and where every person has access to
          nutritious meals. Whether you're a donor or a recipient, you're part
          of something biggerâ€”a movement to feed the hungry, protect the
          environment, and build a more compassionate society.
